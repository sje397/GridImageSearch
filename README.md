# Project 2 - *GridImageSearch*

**GridImageSearch** is an android app that allows a user to search for images on web using simple filters. The app utilizes [Google Image Search API](https://developers.google.com/image-search/). Please note that API has been officially deprecated as of May 26, 2011.

Time spent: **10** hours spent in total

## User Stories

The following **required** functionality is completed:

* [x] User can **search for images** by specifying a query and launching a search. Search displays a grid of image results from the Google Image API.
* [x] User can click on "settings" which allows selection of **advanced search options** to filter results
* [x] User can configure advanced search filters such as:
  * [x] Size (small, medium, large, extra-large)
  * [x] Color filter (black, blue, brown, gray, green, etc...)
  * [x] Type (faces, photo, clip art, line art)
  * [x] Site (espn.com)
* [x] Subsequent searches have any filters applied to the search results
* [x] User can tap on any image in results to see the image **full-screen**
* [x] User can **scroll down to see more images**. The maximum number of images is 64 (limited by API).

The following **optional** features are implemented:

* [x] Implements robust error handling, [check if internet is available](http://guides.codepath.com/android/Sending-and-Managing-Network-Requests#checking-for-network-connectivity), handle error cases, network failures
* [x] Used the **ActionBar SearchView** or custom layout as the query box instead of an EditText
* [ ] User can **share an image** to their friends or email it to themselves
* [ ] Replaced Filter Settings Activity with a lightweight modal overlay
